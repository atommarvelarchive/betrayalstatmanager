#betrayalstatmanager
This is a website built with Node, Express, and Bootstrap. I have no assiciation with the creators of Betrayal at House on the Hill.
Here's what it looks like running: http://betrayalstatmanager.herokuapp.com/

I like to think this is a test run for an app idea I have planned for working on soon. :D

##Build & Run
```
npm install
node app.js
```
